yet another success


so keep up

and again, hello

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

    But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?         



    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us

	



Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
	To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
